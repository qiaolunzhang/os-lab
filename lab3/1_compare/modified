The idea of creating a Hogwarts Express-related element came from Mark Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative.[2][4] After the opening of the Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010, Universal began considering how to keep attendance balanced between the adjacent parks.[5] At first, the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands of Adventure. Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible
from each other. As a result, Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter-themed lands.[2] Several means of transport were proposed for the connector, before settling on idea of the Hogwarts Express train.[2][1]

In early 2011, construction surveying was spotted in the Lost Continent section of Islands of Adventure, and the resort had begun surveying visitors about a possible expansion. This led to rumors that Universal Orlando was planning to expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.[6] At the end of the year, the resort announced the Jaws: The Ride would close on January 2, 2012 to make way for a future development.[7] Almost two and a half years later, WESH-TV, the local NBC affiliate
for the Orlando/Central Florida area, reported that an elevated track system had been installed at Universal Orlando and that the track ran between Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure and a construction area in Universal Studios Florida.[4]

    In May 2013, Universal Orlando announced the expansion of Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express train, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction.[8][9][10] By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both tenders were ready to be assembled on the track.[11] The first of the two trains was installed on the track on October 24, 2013.[12] The second train was placed on the track in early December 2013.[13] On December 2,
    2013, Orlando Attractions Magazine, an amusement park website, spotted one of the trains being tested.[14]

    The resort previewed the interior of the Hogwarts Express in January 2014 through a live cast.[15][16] In mid-March 2014, Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride, including concept animations.[17] The resort announced in June 2014 that the Diagon Alley expansion, including the Hogwarts Express, would officially open to the public on July 8, 2014.[18] A week later, Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express, without any announcement.[19][20]
    Within a month of the Hogwarts Express' opening, one million riders had ridden the Hogwarts Express.[21] It had taken approximately two and a half years to develop,[22] by a team of 150 people.[1]
